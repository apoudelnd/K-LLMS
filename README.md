Literature Review and Roadmaps for robust  Knowledge-based LLMs

This is a list of important knowledge-based natural language processing (NLP) papers that discuss the current research in the field. This list is compiled by the collaborators from **University of Notre Dame, and Deloitte**. 

This list is far from complete or objective, and is evolving, as important papers are being published year after year.

A paper doesn't have to be a peer-reviewed conference/journal paper to appear here. We also include tutorial/survey-style papers and blog posts that are often easier to understand than the original papers.
